Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Energy,"1).Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are emitted from the tailpipes of cars and trucks that combust fuel.
2).Once GHGs are released, they can stay in the atmosphere for 100 years or more.
3).GHGs act like a blanket around Earth, trapping energy in the atmosphere and causing it to warm. This can change Earth's climate, raise sea levels, and result in dangerous effects to human health and welfare, and to ecosystems.",Overall GHG Emissions Globaly,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12iW9IuQMOnmx09bIP0wAi6v7XTcs8260/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110162010493091461426&rtpof=true&sd=true,,
Daily Air Pollution Data - India & USA,"Air Pollution is a major health concern of many. However, the COVID-19 pandemic might have some role to play in bringing some changes to the overall quality of air.","This data could be used to answer several questions -
How the air quality been pre and post-Covid.

How Air Quality varies across different cities.",https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumandey/daily-air-quality-dataset-india,Not many features,Insufficient correlation 
Impact of covid-19 outbreak on global air quality,"We know that air pollution can cause health problems, like heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and high blood pressure, which have been identified as the pre-existing medical conditions that raise the chances of death from COVID-19 infection. Emerging research finds that breathing more polluted air over many years may itself worsen the effects of COVID-19.","Data has many sheets for different countries like India, wuhan, Usa NY, Delhi EU etc.

US Air Quality 1980-Present,"AQI or Air Quality Index is the primary way to measure the current quality of the air. AQI values range from 0-500 with 0 being perfectly healthy and 500 being extremally hazardous. AQI values are derived from moving averages/current values of PM2.5 (particulate matter), PM10, Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide levels",We can make comparison for AQI before and after covid outbreak for USA.,https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/calebreigada/us-air-quality-1980present,Dataset is very small for 5 people,
